# DataStructures

Data Structures are different ways of organizing data stored in order to improve access velocity, storing capacity or any other features depending on each situation. Data Structures are a fundamental concept in computer science, allowing complex algorithms to work efficiently.

This repository contains all of the data structures and algorithms listed below:
- Doubly Linked List
- Bubble Sort

### Doubly Linked List
##### Doubly Linked List is a data structure composed by nodes. Each node represents some type of data and has a pointer to the next and the previous node, allowing navigating back and forward through nodes. This concept is an evolution of a Singly Linked List, that is only capable of pointing to the next node.

### Bubble Sort
##### Bubble Sort is a O(n²) sorting algorithm that takes the greatest number of each iteration and leave it at the end of the list. At the end of all iterations, we have a sorted array. Although it's not recommended for big arrays, it's simpler implementation allows sorting with no much effort.
